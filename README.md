This repo contains code for IT506 course project "Speeding Up Jacobi Eigenvalue Algorithm using HPC" under Prof. Bhaskar Choudhary. 

#How to Run?
jacobi_parallel.cu is the parallel code for Jacobi Algorithm. It uses the Input files which are named in the format 'input\_128.txt' consisting a symmetric matrix of size 128 x 128. By default the code takes 'input_512.txt' as an input.

jacobi_serial.py is the serial code for the same algorithm.
